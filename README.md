## Have you ever wanted to try out the closet app Cher used in the Clueless movie?

Now is your chance to feel what it would have been like to have a *"way normal life for a teenager"*, (as Cher liked to say) in the '90s!

Features in this retro-inspired app include:
- A visualization of how different shirts, pants, shoes would look on you.
- Adding more clothing to your closet.
- Saving outfits from your closet and being able to load them.
